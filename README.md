# NLP_debate_analysis

This repo contains the script for natural language processing analysis that I did for the first presidential deabte in 2016 between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.

Transcript was taken from deabtes.org https://www.debates.org/voter-education/debate-transcripts/september-26-2016-debate-transcript/

I used the following R packages to perform the analysis

* rvest
* stringr
* plyr
* ggmap
* dplyr
* plyr
* tm
* wordcloud
* datasets
* maps
* countrycode
* psData
* rworldmap
* syuzhet
* sentiment
